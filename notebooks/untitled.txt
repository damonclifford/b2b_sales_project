The surrogate function gives us an estimate of the objective function, which can be used to direct future sampling. Sampling involves careful use of the posterior in a function known as the “acquisition” function, e.g. for acquiring more samples. We want to use our belief about the objective function to sample the area of the search space that is most likely to pay off, therefore the acquisition will optimize the conditional probability of locations in the search to generate the next sample.



Acquisition Function: Technique by which the posterior is used to select the next sample from the search space.
Once additional samples and their evaluation via the objective function f() have been collected, they are added to data D and the posterior is then updated.

This process is repeated until the extrema of the objective function is located, a good enough result is located, or resources are exhausted.

The Bayesian Optimization algorithm can be summarized as follows:

1. Select a Sample by Optimizing the Acquisition Function.
2. Evaluate the Sample With the Objective Function.
3. Update the Data and, in turn, the Surrogate Function.
4. Go To 1.
